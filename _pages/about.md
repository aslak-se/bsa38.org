“On my honor, I will do my best, to do my duty, to God and my country, to obey the Scout Law, to help other people at all times, and to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.”

This Oath, memorized and repeated by the Scouts of Troop 38, as well as Scouts across the nation, serves as a means for boys to grow into responsible, caring men, reminding them of their duty to God, country, neighbor, family, and self. Together with the twelve points of the Scout Law, the Scout Oath is the driving principle behind the Boy Scouts of America.
 
Boys in Troop 38 learn the Oath, as well as the Law, by heart, and repeat both at the beginning of each weekly meeting. These ideals were first set by the founders of the Scouting Movement over one hundred years ago, and they inspire Troop 38 to achieve a high standard of excellence in all of its service and activities.
